# YASAP
Yet Another SimConnect Arduino Project

This project utilizes the Firmata protocol for the serial communication between PC and arduino.

There is still alot of things to do heres whats working 
 - Can Connect to MSFS, vJoy, and Arduino 
 - Events are raised for SimConnect information , and messages to and from the arduino 

The things left to do (prolly frogetting a lot)
  - User makes mapping between arduino/simconnect/vjoy
  - link the mappings accordingly 
  - save mappings; 
  - make profiles based off aircraft, to avoid having to switch profiles manually. 
  - create a library (I want it to work very akin to how DCSBios works). to allow users to Map values to whatever device they choose. 
  - allow connection of multiple arduinos and vJoy devices;
